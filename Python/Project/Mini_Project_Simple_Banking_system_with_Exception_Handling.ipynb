    "##### Problem Statement: You must create a simple Python program simulating a bank account withdrawal process. The program should: \n",
    "###### 1)Ask the user for their account balance and the amount they want to withdraw. \n",
    "###### 2)Check for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values). \n",
    "###### 3)Handle the following cases -\n",
    "######   - trying to withdraw more money than available or trying to withdraw a negative amount.\n",
    "######   - The account balance entered is negative or zero.\n",
    "######   - The program should allow a maximum of 3 withdrawal attempts. If the user fails all attempt, display a message and terminate the program."
